## Blerkchain
___

This is a very simple Sinatra app adapted from a great [block chain tutorial written in python](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).

Allows transactions to be added to a "blockchain" and then for blocks of transactions to be mined and added to the chain.

This also leverages a nice little [sinatra-bootstrap boilerplate repo](https://github.com/bootstrap-ruby/sinatra-bootstrap)
